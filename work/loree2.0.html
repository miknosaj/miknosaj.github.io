        I worked alongside a small team of designers at <a class="white" href="http://www.momentdesign.com/">Moment</a> from user research to product design. We designed for Voice UI’s and how they might be used to empower immigrant families and parents to raise their children to be multilingual in a culturally immersive home.

        Loree is an Artificially Intelligent companion that incorporates language through conversation and storytelling to introduce cultural concepts to children in immigrant families. As children grow older and their speech patterns become more complex, Loree helps expand their understanding of abstract concepts and ensures that parents are taking an active role in this learning process.

        Voice activated assistants are some of the hottest products in the smart-home market and yet, despite significant innovation in hardware, and the many talented developers that work on making them as 'smart' as they are, voice assistants are still remarkably irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide mt0-ns">
        Even now, most voice assistants follow a command/response paradigm that is only working to streamline screen-based navigation. Our team wanted to go beyond that paradigm and design a voice UI that looked at voice in a new way and took its strengths into account by highlighting conversation as a unique and humanized interaction.

        In order to better define and come to understand our problem space, we interviewed a group of parents who would help us empathize with the many challenges that they face in parenting.
      </p>
      <p class="pt3 bb f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide">
        Obstacles
      </p>
      <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide mt0-ns">
        Initially, we had written an interview protocol that was more suited for evaluating pain points in a user flow for step-by-step interactions.
      </p>
      <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide">
        In our interview dry-runs, parents had trouble recalling past experiences when asked up-front, but would bring them up while talking about a related topic. We needed a better way to get parents to recall their experiences without making them feel too pressured.
      </p>
      <p class="pt3 bb f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide">
        Solution
      </p>
      <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide mt0-ns">
        From books and online resources, we learned about different parenting milestones and common challenges and we used them to overhaul our entire interview protocol to shift the focus on letting parents tell stories of how they faced those different milestones and challenges.
      </p>
      <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide mt0-ns">
        We created a game-like activity called “conjure cards” using cards depicting a specific milestone that parents would flip from face down in pairs upon which they would choose one to speak on. The reactive and evenly paced nature of this activity did a lot to help “conjure” the parents’ memories where, before, they had trouble.

      </div></div>
      <p class="pt3 bb f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide">
        Why?
      </p>
      <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide mt0-ns">
        While understanding the stresses of parenting are important, we needed to go in deeper:
      </p>
      <ul class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide mt0-ns">
        <li>In what ways do parents view themselves responsible for their children?</li>
        <li>What are parents hesitant to do or expose their children to?</li>
        <li>What do parents prioritize in raising their kids?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide mt0-ns">
        The stories that parents told us about their experiences did much more to flesh out the information that we were looking for while also allowing us to make the parents comfortable to speak.
      </p>
      <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide mt0-ns">
        As we focused on conversation based on these stories, we came to empathize with parenting on an emotional and mental level and we used that understanding to see how each parent differed from the other.
