          <p class="f5 lh-copy measure mt0">
            Report Builder is an interactive tool for our clients to have complete control over their campaign reports. The Report Builder is composed of three parts: The FDM (Filters Dimensions, and Metrics), the workspace (where the users drag and drop the FDM tiles), and a preview of what the report will look like.

            <li>There are constraints that have not been built into the workflow which means that users will make many accidents and face a lot of error messages. (like Filters being set before Dimensions and Metrics)</li>
            <li>The hierarchical structure between Filters, Dimensions, and Metrics is not visualized as they all are represented similarly in the UI.</li>
            <li>The drag and drop interaction, while great for customizability, demands too much motion from the users as they go through many Filters, Dimensions, and Metrics.</li>
            <li>Users are not able to take full advantage of how their spreadsheets would be formatted as the spreadsheet visualization is simply a preview.</li>

            Servo Alerts is how our clients are alerted of any unexpected behaviour within their campaigns. Alerts would be sent to the client's emails.

        Our platform's users are people who know exactly what they want out of a campaign and what variables they need to leverage in order to achieve their campaign goals.
