      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        It was crucial for me to understand the background of our products and its various stakeholders across the departments to better understand our industry, clients, and users. I used these insights to answer several important questions.
      </p>
      <p class="show-first pt3 bb f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        What is Report Builder?
      </p>
      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        Report Builder is an interactive tool for our clients to have complete control over their campaign reports. The Report Builder is composed of three parts: The FDM (Filters Dimensions, and Metrics), the workspace (where the users drag and drop the FDM tiles), and a preview of what the report will look like.

        What is Servo Alerts?
      </p>
      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        Servo Alerts is how our clients are alerted of any unexpected behaviour within their campaigns. Alerts would be sent to the client's emails.

        Who are the users?
      </p>
      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        The users are ad operation teams who manage and report on the performance of their online (mobile, in our case) advertisements.

        üîë  Findings for Report Builder:
      </p>
      <ul class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        <li>There are constraints that have not been built into the workflow which means that users will make many accidents and face a lot of error messages. (like Filters being set before Dimensions and Metrics)</li>
        <li>The hierarchical structure between Filters, Dimensions, and Metrics is not visualized as they all are represented similarly in the UI.</li>
        <li>The drag and drop interaction, while great for customizability, demands too much motion from the users as they go through many Filters, Dimensions, and Metrics.</li>
        <li>Users are not able to take full advantage of how their spreadsheets would be formatted as the spreadsheet visualization is simply a preview.</li>

        <li>Alerts are sent by email and only by email.</li>
        <li>Specific alerts were sent as a spreadsheet style document making it hard to read and quickly interpret at times.</li>
        <li>Too much information is being told even though there is an identifiable pattern.</li>

        Report Builder
      </p>
      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        I used the insight from my research and stakeholder interviews to guide my evaluation of the flow of the Report Builder and to identify its pain points.
      </p>
      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        While doing my own evaluation of the workflow and creating a detailed site-map, I came across several bugs that were relevant to plausible edge cases. Thankfully, understanding the process to recreate the bug gave me a chance to work with Medialets' bug tracking system, JIRA, to log them.

        Ideas for Report Builder
      </p>
      <ul class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        <li>Make filters a prerequisite before moving on to Dimensions and Metrics.</li>
        <li>Organize Dimensions and Metrics tiles into groups based on similarity so that users won't have to scroll through so many.</li>
        <li>Rather than having users drop tiles into a workspace that then reflects on a preview, have the users interact directly with the preview.</li>

      </div></div>
      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        These are the flows that I constructed where filters take precedence over Dimensions and metrics and where dragging and dropping are more effective actions.

        Servo Alerts

      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        The same insights were used in creating a better way for users to look at their alerts.
      </p>
      <p class="show-first f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure-wide center">
        Once I understood every aspect to each alert type and their level of importance, I applied what I had learned from my interviews and my own evaluation to the flow for the notifications panel.

        This flow demonstrates how information starts in digestible parts which allow users to take action if necessary rather than having to see everything in separate parts across different apps.
