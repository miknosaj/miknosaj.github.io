Compared to what I saw with my own eyes, a two-dimensional image seemed to hold uncanny power over my emotions. But fascination quickly gave way to confusion. The photos I thought were beautiful weren’t the ones in the books I found: William Eggleston’s Guide, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, Pictures from Home. These didn’t look beautiful at all. Still, I wasn’t naïve enough to dismiss them outright. If the most respected art institutions in the world celebrated these works, then there was something I wasn’t yet seeing."},{type:"text",content:"Over a decade of training my eye and taking photos as a stubborn hobbyist has taught me to recognize their merit and power, and I regret not seeing it sooner. I am not formally trained, nor is this going to be a comprehensive history. But my wish, if you’ll read on, is to share just how extraordinary photography can be. And if you too have ever felt confused by what you see in museums and books, as I once was, I hope you’ll come to see it again with a renewed perspective."},{type:"sectionHeader",title:"Pictorialism"},{type:"text",content:"Photography, like painting and other art forms, was transformed by modernism.
